# Assignment

- In groups of 3 - 4 students, select two papers or book chapters of secondary literature related to the topic.
- By using collaborative writing tools (at the moment, Git + Markdown), compose an entry for an annotated bibliography
    - Create a summary of the argument of the reading. It should include:
        - Information about the author, the philosophical tradition she or he belongs to, any methodological committments that are relevant to the text
        - Information about the publication / publisher
        - A step for step summary of the argument being made
    - Explain how the reading relates to the primary text discussed in class
    - Critically assess the argument proposed in the secondary literature
- Engage critically with the summaries provided by others:
    - Propose changes of
        - Definitions and explanations of concepts
        - Examples and thought experiments
        - Argument and paper structure
    - Comment on
        - Matters of substantial disagreement (different interpretations of the argument, different takes on the merits of the argument)
    - Reconcile
        - Propose solutions to any conflicts between two group members:
        - Disambiguating, clarifying concepts and ensuring that the conversation takes place in a clearly delimited field
- Agree upon a final product that incorporates the surviving, peer-reviewed attitudes towards the reading.

# Learning Goals

- Students understand the importance of collaboration for the development of philosophical arguments.
- Students become attuned to the subtleties of philosophical argument by engaging with the written output of their peers and reconciling it with their own.
- Students become efficient mediators in philosophical disputes by considering all sides of the argument and incorporating the most important aspects of each position into a final product.
- Students understand how to gainfully employ technological means to manage collaborative efforts in paper writing.


# Assessment

- This assignment is mostly assessed according to the collaborative process. The end result is only of minor importance. (Graded Pass / Fail, perhaps)
- The collaborative process is graded along five dimensions
    - Organization and division of labor by developing a work plan and assigning tasks to group members (Collective Assessment)
    - Speedy and dutiful execution of individual tasks in accordance with the work plan developed early on (Individual Assessment)
    - Quality of change / merge requests on others' contributions (Individual)
    - Efficiency and creativity in reconciling opinions (Individual)
    - Willingness and ability to incorporate critique by others in one's own writing (Individual)
