# Innovation

- Analyze and visualize patterns in classroom
- e.g. active question posing helps attentiveness

# For my assignment:

## Traditional group collaboration 'workflow'

- Groups are assigned, some members set up an initial meeting date well towards the deadline for the project
- Nothing happens
- Some members set up an outline / choose a text / distribute workload
- Nothing happens
- Everyone rushes to finish presentation before deadline

## Idealized workflow:

- Groups are assigned. Members immediately sit together and create their repository and collaboration tools (*in class*)
- Micro-goals require small but significant steps outside class (*outside class*)
