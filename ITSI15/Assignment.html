<ul>
<li>In groups of 3 - 4 students, select two papers or book chapters of secondary literature related to the topic.</li>
<li>By using collaborative writing tools (at the moment, Git + Markdown), compose an entry for an annotated bibliography
<ul>
<li>Create a summary of the argument of the reading. It should include:
<ul>
<li>Information about the author, the philosophical tradition she or he belongs to, any methodological committments that are relevant to the text</li>
<li>Information about the publication / publisher</li>
<li>A step for step summary of the argument being made</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explain how the reading relates to the primary text discussed in class</li>
<li>Critically assess the argument proposed in the secondary literature</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Engage critically with the summaries provided by others:
<ul>
<li>Propose changes of

<li>Definitions and explanations of concepts</li>
<li>Examples and thought experiments</li>
<li>Argument and paper structure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comment on
<ul>
<li>Matters of substantial disagreement (different interpretations of the argument, different takes on the merits of the argument)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reconcile
<ul>

<li>Disambiguating, clarifying concepts and ensuring that the conversation takes place in a clearly delimited field</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Agree upon a final product that incorporates the surviving, peer-reviewed attitudes towards the reading.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h1>

<li>Students become efficient mediators in philosophical disputes by considering all sides of the argument and incorporating the most important aspects of each position into a final product.</li>
<li>Students understand how to gainfully employ technological means to manage collaborative efforts in paper writing.</li>
</ul>
