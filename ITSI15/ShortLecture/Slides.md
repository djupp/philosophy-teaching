## Democracy --- Voting:

- Choice between very few options
- Mechanism of aggregation and impact obvious
- Expectation of equal input

## Markets --- Buying and Selling:

- Incredibly frequent events
- Very diverse options
- Mechanism of aggregation intransparent
- Acceptance of power imbalances

# Questions to be studied

- For both systems, claim is that we know of no better one
- What is *better* in this context?
    - Preliminary intuition: better is defined in completely different ways for the two systems. 
    - E.g. transparency vs. invisible hand
- In how far are we actually interested in the choice aggregation properties of these systems?
