# Choice Mechanisms

## Democracy — Voting: 

- Rare event
- Choice between very few options
- Mechanism of aggregation and impact obvious
- Expectation of equal input

## Markets — Buying and Selling:

- Incredibly frequent events
- Very diverse options
- Mechanism of aggregation intransparent
- Acceptance of power imbalances

--------------------

# Example — Choosing Pizza

- Go to the polls on: [pollev.com/strongtemple442](pollev.com/strongtemple442)

. . .

- A democratic choice

. . .

- Haggling

---------------------

# Questions to be studied

- For both systems, claim is that we know of no better one
- What is *better* in this context?
    - Preliminary intuition: better is defined in completely different ways for the two systems. 
    - E.g. transparency vs. invisible hand
- In how far are we actually interested in the choice aggregation properties of these systems?
    - Markets are often justified with reference to consumer freedom, entrepreneurship, etc.
    - Democracies by reference to equality, value of citizenship, etc.
